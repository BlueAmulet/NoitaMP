1. start server manually or automatically
2. client connects to server
    + wait until server accept the connection
    + if accepted, alert on client "wait until map is saved and synced"
    + wait timeout time and reconnect
4. server has to accept connection in mod settings or key press?
5. server sent alert to clients "going to save and quit and restart server - progess on client wont be saved"
    + keep clients somehow in mind (mac address?)
    + save, quits, restart game and automatically start server
    + wait for reconnect of client
6. when client reconncets, server will check remembered client (mac address)
    + if match, then sent map
    + alert, pls do not move
    + if no match, dont accept connection
7. pause game somehow, until all clients sent "map received" to server
8. clients restart noita (force quit without saving) 
    + automatically reconnect to server after restart
    + sent to server "map received"
8. server got all "map received" messages and stop pausing
9. enjoy NoitMP
