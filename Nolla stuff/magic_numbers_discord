23:58] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: what are magic numbers used for? seed changer used it to set the world seed. I tried it, but looks like I need to name it magic_numbers.xml
Is it "allowed" to have more than one? what can be inside this file?
[23:58] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: are savegames depending on magic_numbers?
[23:58] Horscht: it's basically just some settings that's in there, that's all, like a configuration file
[23:58] Horscht: you can check out all (I think) the possible values in save00/magic_numbers.xml
[23:59] Horscht: that file contains all the magic numbers used for the current run and some persist permanently
[23:59] Horscht: you can override those values by registering your own magic numbers file using ModMagicNumbersFileAdd

[00:00] Horscht: point it to any XML with the following structure and it will overwrite that value:
<MagicNumbers 
  DESIGN_PLAYER_START_POS_X="227" 
  DESIGN_PLAYER_START_POS_Y="-85"
></MagicNumbers>

[00:01] Konnari:  thanks!
[00:02] Horscht: and yeah there can be any number of magic numbers files registered but I'm not sure if the first instance gets dibs on the change or the last
[00:02] peremptor: is there any entity, that is guarenteed to be loaded. untill the game or the run is being closed ? i need something to tack my save values onto but they stop being accessible as soon as the player dies.

[00:03] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: ModMagicNumbersFileAdd has to set in ModPreInit()?
@Horscht

[00:03] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: Sorry, I dont understand
@peremptor

[00:03] Horscht: you can just create your own entity or use the world state entity GameGetWorldStateEntity() but I've never modified it so I don't know how it will react
@.twitch.tv/ismoh_
ModMagicNumbersFileAdd has to set in ModPreInit()?
[00:04] Horscht: ModMagicNumbersFileAdd has to be called before magic numbers are loaded, which is somewhere around mod intialization, I always use it at the top level outside any callback function (Bearbeitet)
[00:05] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: Init.lua for instance
[00:05] Horscht: after the game has been initialized, those values can't be changed anymore
[00:05] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: That might be my problem (Bearbeitet)
[00:05] Horscht: you can see it in the console when it happens
Loading MagicNumbers (??SAV/magic_numbers.xml)
Loading MagicNumbers (data/magic_numbers.xml)
Loading MagicNumbers (mods/p2k/files/scripts/magic_numbers_resolution.xml)
Loading MagicNumbers (mods/AdventureMode/_virtual/magic_numbers.xml)
[00:07] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: ??SAV looks like to be the savegame, isnt it?
[00:08] Horscht: yes
[00:09] Giga Nuke™: Does anyone know where the sprites for the hungry/mournful ghost are located? I found the angry ghost but for some reason the other two are hard to find.
[00:12] Horscht: data/projectiles_gfx/hungry_ghost.png
[00:14] Giga Nuke™: Yeah just checked and it's not there for some reason, odd.
[00:14] Horscht: did you unpack the data?
[00:15] Giga Nuke™: Yeah, it was on my desktop for some time though so maybe I accidently deleted it. Lemme get a fresh unpack. (Bearbeitet)
[00:17] Giga Nuke™: Yeah my bad, I found it after getting a fresh pack. My bad.
[00:37] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: I would like to continue modding, but I have a really bad cold and I am just doing a lot of mistakes.. Cant think properly!
[00:37] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: took the magic numbers to my note, thanks @Horscht
[00:38] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: one last thing: my magic_numbers shouldnt be in mods/noita-mp/data, because I dont want to override anything?!
[00:39] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: besides world seed for now
[00:39] .twitch.tv/ismoh_: ok, nevermind XD
