# Noita Multiplayer

I love to play Noita! You should give it a try: [Noita](https://noitagame.com/)
Usually I like to play with my friends. Truly Noita is made for beeing a singleplayer game,
but I can't get rid of the idea to try implemting a multiplayer mod, just to share all the feelings playing Noita with friends.
Let's see, if I can do so?!

## Noita Together Reference

[Noita Together](https://github.com/soler91/noita-together) is a mod I was inspired by trying to do my own mod!
It's awesome and it's more or less a reference to this. Just to be clear, there is no 'stolen' code. So try it out!
